				<h1>Sadabahar Plan</h1>
				<p>Sadabahar is an anticipated endowment type with-profit plan that provides lump sum benefit at certain
					stages during the premium-paying term or on earlier death. In addition, this plan has a built-in
					Accidental Death Benefit (ADB) rider so that the policyholder gets an additional sum assured in case
					of death due to an accident.
					<br>
					This plan is a safe instrument for cash provision at the time of need. With this plan, the
					policyholder can secure greater protection and continued prosperity for the family at an affordable
					cost.<br>
					Admissible Ages and Terms This plan is available to all members of the general public, aged from 20
					to 60 years nearest birthday. Both males and females may purchase this plan. Terms offered under
					this plan are 12,15,18, 21, 24, 27 and 30 years.
				</p>
				<p>Allowable Riders: which can be attached with this plan.</p>
				<p>This is a joint life plan and covers lives of two partners say husband and wife simultaneously.
					Premiums are payable till the end of the specified term or till death of either of the insured
					persons, if earlier. The plan contains extensive benefits; an overview of which appears as under:
				</p>
				<p>On the death of the first life, the sum insured will be paid to the survivor. Further premiums under
					the policy will be waived, but the insurance protection of the second life will continue. Also, the
					policy will continue to participate in profits of the Corporation. On death of the second life,
					again the sum insured will be paid together with the attaching bonuses. In this event the policy
					will terminate.</p>
				<p>If the second life survives the term of the policy, he or she will be paid sum insured together with
					the attached bonuses, even though the sum insured has been paid once, on the death of the first
					life. If both the lives survive the term of the policy, the sum insured will be paid to them
					jointly, only once, together with the attached bonuses. Different supplementary covers are also
					available for increasing coverage under the policy.</p>
				<p>Jeevan Sathi Plan is best suited for those married couples who want to enjoy insurance coverage for a
					comparatively lesser premium. Moreover, housewives who are otherwise not insurable can also enjoy
					the benefits of insurance policy through this plan.</p>
